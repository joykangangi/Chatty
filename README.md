 This project is aimed at implementing different methods of state management.
 Since compose is declarative, we have to maintain state of individual UI elements.
 State is anything that can change e.g. TextField (EditText).
 There are three ways to manage state:
 State Hoisting,
 Using State Holders and
 ViewModel
